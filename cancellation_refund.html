            <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>

            <p>At Jewecle, we understand that circumstances may change, and you may need to cancel your subscription or
                booking. We strive to make the cancellation process as transparent and convenient as possible. Please
                review the following cancellation policy:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Subscription Cancellations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Monthly Subscriptions: Monthly subscriptions can be canceled at any time. Upon
                            cancellation, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing
                            cycle, and you will not be charged for the subsequent month.</li>
                        <li>- Annual Subscriptions: You can cancel your annual subscription, but refunds will not be
                            provided. Your subscription will remain active until the end of the current subscription
                            period.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
